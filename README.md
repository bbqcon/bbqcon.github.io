BBQcon: Built by developers.

Welcome to the home page for BBQcon, a new kind of conference. The goal of BBQcon is not to add another conference to already busy schedules, but instead create a conference with a purpose. We even have a tough time referring to it as a conference; we'd prefer collaborative gathering. A gathering that, after the final talk, has made it's industry better instead of pointing out its flaws. A gathering that recognizes we can't change the state of things in a day - but we can work together to slowly improve it, and make our lives better. Couple all of this with amazing, local food, and we think we've got a pretty good combination.

Welcome to BBQcon.
